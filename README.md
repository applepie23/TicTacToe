# TicTacToe Game

## Project Description
This project gives two users the ability to play a game of tic-tac-toe together. I used Javascript, HTML, and CSS to implement the project. It was difficult to decide how to code an efficient method of knowing who won and when. In the future, I may implement a mode where a singular user can play against a computer. 

## How to Use the Project
I set up a github page to display the functionality of the project. The game is self-explanatory, but there alternating PLayer X and Player O turns to simulate a game of tic-tac-toe and a reset button.
